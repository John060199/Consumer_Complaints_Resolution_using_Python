# Consumer Complaints Resolution/Customer Dispute Prediction

Welcome to the Customer Dispute Prediction project! This Python-based project leverages powerful libraries and machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer dispute is likely to occur based on provided data. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or business professional, this project offers valuable insights and predictive capabilities to enhance decision-making and customer relationship management.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Operations:** Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas to efficiently manage and preprocess the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employ Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize and analyze the dataset, uncovering valuable patterns and insights.
- **Machine Learning Model Building:** Leverage Scikit-Learn (Sklearn) to build predictive models based on the processed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of different machine learning models and select the best-performing one.
- **Dispute Prediction:** Utilize the chosen model to predict whether a customer dispute is likely based on given data.
- **Result Output:** Save the prediction results for further analysis or action.
